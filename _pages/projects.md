## Strategic Research Domains

### 1. Herbal Drug Standardization & Quality Assurance
**Focus:** Development of pharmacopoeial standards, marker selection, chromatographic fingerprinting (HPLC, HSCCC), and validation systems aligned with GACP-WHO and ASEAN harmonization.

**Representative Topics**
- Marker-based quality standard development
- Method validation and chromatographic fingerprinting
- Regulatory alignment and export-readiness frameworks

---

### 2. Medicinal Plant R&D and Translational Development
**Focus:** From phytochemistry to commercialization pathways.

**Representative Topics**
- Extraction optimization
- Bioactive compound isolation
- Product formulation and pilot-scale standardization
- IP strategy and product positioning

---

### 3. Ethnopharmacology & Digital Knowledge Systems
**Focus:** Documentation, digitization, and scientific validation of traditional medicinal knowledge.

**Representative Topics**
- Database development for indigenous medicinal knowledge
- Data-driven validation frameworks
- Integration of traditional knowledge with modern analytics
